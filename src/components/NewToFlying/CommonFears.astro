    question: "Is it safe?",
    answer: `Safety is our primary directive. Beyond FAA oversight, ${COMPANY_NAME} maintains a dedicated on-site maintenance team and a senior instructor cadre with decades of airline experience. Our 12-year zero-cancellation record for checkrides is proof that our aircraft and pilots are mission-ready.`,

  },
  {
    question: "What if I'm nervous about heights or bumps?",
    answer:
      "Cockpit security is different from standing on a ledge; you are strapped into a structured environment. Turbulence is simply air movement—much like driving over a gravel road. Most students find their anxiety vanishes once they understand the aerodynamics behind the movement.",

  },
  {
    question: "How fit do I need to be?",
    answer:
      "For the Professional Track, you'll need an FAA First Class Medical Certificate (checking vision, hearing, and heart health). Most people pass without issue. We will guide you to a local Aviation Medical Examiner (AME) to get cleared before you spend a dime on training.",

  },
  {
    question: "When do I actually touch the controls?",
    answer:
      "Immediately. We believe in tactile learning. On your very first flight, you’ll handle basic maneuvers while airborne. Your instructor manages the critical takeoff and landing phases, but you are the one flying for the majority of the lesson.",

  {
    question: "Do I have to commit to an airline career now?",
    answer:
      "No. Every captain started with a single discovery flight. You can earn your Private Pilot License first and transition into the Professional Track later. Your training remains modular and high-standard regardless of your end goal.",

  },
  {
    question: "What about motion sickness?",
    answer:
      "Flying the airplane yourself actually reduces motion sickness because your brain anticipates the movement. If you're prone to car sickness, we simply take the first few lessons at a slower pace until your 'inner ear' adjusts to the new environment.",
