  description:
    "A discovery flight is a sneak peek into the world of aviation and a chance to get your feet a little wet. We think it's a pretty good idea and the best first step for anyone dreaming of flying. At Pitcairn Flight Academy, we're all about providing a hands on experience and making sure you're making the right call when it comes to your aviation journey.\n\nDuring a discovery flight, you get to hop into the cockpit, take the controls, and feel what it's like to be the one flying the plane. It's a bit like a test drive for flying, without the pressure of committing to a full blown pilot's license. We recommend it because there's usually two outcomes out of the introductory flight. One, either you don't like it and you can determine that becoming is not right for you. Or two, you fall in love with it and you make the decision that becoming a pilot is right for you. It's usually the latter. So don't wait, get on the schedule today and let's go flying together.",
