Every airline captain, corporate pilot, and flight instructor started exactly where you are now—with a dream and the determination to make it reality. At Pitcairn Flight Academy, we’ve been helping pilots turn that dream into a professional career at Heritage Field Airport (KPTW) in Pennsylvania.

Every pilot’s journey is unique, and our flexible training model ensures you progress at the pace that fits your goals, schedule, and learning style.

## Stage 1: Private Pilot Certificate

Your aviation career begins with the Private Pilot Certificate. This phase builds foundational skills, aeronautical decision-making, and confidence in real-world flying.

Training includes ground school, solo experience, weather analysis, navigation, and checkride preparation. By the time you earn your PPL, you’ll have the mindset required for professional aviation.

## Stage 2: Instrument Rating

The Instrument Rating transforms pilots into precision aviators capable of flying safely in low-visibility conditions.

Students learn to fly in IMC, execute instrument approaches, navigate complex airspace, and make confident decisions using cockpit instruments and ATC guidance.

## Stage 3: Commercial Pilot Certificate

The Commercial Certificate allows pilots to fly for compensation. Training focuses on advanced maneuvers, complex aircraft systems, and professional-level flight standards.

Reaching 250 hours includes diverse flying experiences that build judgment, confidence, and consistency.

## Stage 4: Certified Flight Instructor

Becoming a CFI is one of the most effective ways to build flight time while earning income. Teaching others strengthens technical knowledge, communication skills, and leadership abilities.

## Stage 5: Launching Your Career

Graduates pursue careers in airlines, charter operations, corporate aviation, aerial survey, and flight instruction. Our instructors help students plan career paths and connect with industry opportunities.
