## Announcing the 3rd Annual Heritage Field (KPTW) Fly-In Event

The Heritage Field Airport will be hosting its 3rd Annual Fly-In Event, set to take place from May 10th to 12th, 2024. Pilots and aviation enthusiasts, mark your calendars for this exciting event that promises exhilarating moments and a gathering of passionate aviators from Pottstown, Northwest Philadelphia, and beyond.

In preparation for our event, we encourage you to read the following information and procedures to ensure you have a smooth arrival and departure.

## Traffic Advisory for Pilots

During the event, heightened VFR (Visual Flight Rules) traffic is anticipated within a 10 NM radius of the airport during daylight hours. Participating pilots need to note that certain aircraft might not be equipped with ADS-B or certified with an electrical system. This condition applies to aircraft both originally uncertified and those lacking subsequent certification with such systems installed.

## Arrival and Departure Procedures

Pilots participating in the Fly-In are encouraged to adhere to specific arrival and departure procedures to ensure safe and efficient operations during the event.

### Communication and Lighting

Pilots are requested to communicate their position and intentions via installed or handheld equipment and activate all available aircraft lighting systems when approaching or departing KPTW.

### Flight Planning

Adequate preflight planning is vital, including fuel reserves in case of potential diversions to alternate airports.

### Radio Communications

Aircraft without installed two-way radio communication capabilities are advised to utilize handheld equipment to facilitate communication between aircraft and/or ATC.

### Maneuvering Instructions

Unless directed otherwise by ATC, all landing or departing maneuvers at PTW should be executed north of Rwy 10/28, avoiding overflight of the power plant west of the airfield.

## Flight Coordination and Compliance

For pilots operating within 30 nautical miles of PHL (Philadelphia International Airport), certain regulations apply based on aircraft equipment and certifications as per 14 CFR 91.215 and 91.225. Additionally, specific communication frequencies and procedures for different airports and airspace classifications are provided for clear coordination.

## Safety Measures and Advisory

Pilots must be aware of the Philadelphia Glider Council at Philadelphia Gliderport (3PA2) and Skydive Philadelphia skydiving operations at Pennridge Airport (CKZ). Flight routes should be planned to avoid these areas for the safety of all operations.

## Event Logistics

Aircraft parking will be designated on the south side of the Heritage Field Airport, and participants are urged to follow marshaller directions for efficient parking. Heritage Field eagerly anticipates welcoming pilots and aviation enthusiasts to the 3rd Annual Fly-In Event. Stay tuned for further updates and detailed information as the event approaches.
