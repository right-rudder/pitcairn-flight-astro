question: "What about motion sickness?"

Some people experience mild motion sickness on their first few flights, but it usually subsides as you gain experience. Flying the airplane yourself (rather than being a passenger) actually helps because you're anticipating the movements. Your instructor can adjust maneuvers if needed, and most students adapt quickly. If you get car sick easily, mention it—we'll take it slow.
