A basic Private Pilot License typically takes 50–70 hours of flight time and several months of training, depending on your schedule and weather. Professional pathways (zero-to-airlines) bundle all required ratings and run 12–18 months for students training full-time. Part-time students can progress at their own pace around work and family commitments.
