On a discovery flight, most instructors let you handle basic maneuvers on day one under close supervision. You'll fly straight and level, make gentle turns, and feel how the airplane responds. Your instructor handles takeoff and landing on the first flight, but you're actively flying for most of the lesson. It's hands-on from the very beginning.
