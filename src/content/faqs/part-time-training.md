question: "Can I train part-time while working?"
category: "Training"

Yes! While our career-track students train full-time to finish in 8-10 months, many students progress part-time around work and family commitments. You can fly as frequently or infrequently as your schedule allows. We recommend at least 2-3 flights per week to maintain consistency and proficiency, but ultimately you control the pace.
