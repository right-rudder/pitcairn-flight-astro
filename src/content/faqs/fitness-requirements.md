For recreational flying (Sport Pilot or Private Pilot with a driver's license medical), most healthy adults qualify. For professional flying careers, you'll need an FAA medical certificate—either a 3rd class (easier) or 1st class (airline standard). The exam checks vision, hearing, cardiovascular health, and mental fitness. Most people pass without issues, and even common conditions like controlled diabetes or corrected vision are often acceptable.
