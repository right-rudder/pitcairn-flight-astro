Absolutely. All flight training is governed by strict FAA oversight with certified instructors, rigorous maintenance standards, and comprehensive safety protocols. General aviation has a strong safety culture, and  exceeds FAA requirements—we've maintained a 12-year zero-cancellation record for checkrides, proving our commitment to aircraft availability and safety.
