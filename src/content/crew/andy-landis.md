bio: "Originally from Souderton, PA, Andy started his time in flight training over 20 years ago. What started as an escape from a busy day job soon evolved into a love and passion for flying. Since then, Andy has surged through the ranks and acquired an impressive list of certificates and ratings (like ATP, CFI, CFII, MEI, CFI-G, tailwheel, and float plane pro) to accompany his extensive knowledge in flight training. Outside of Pitcairn Flight Academy, you can find Andy flying his KR-03A glider, scuba diving, and going on other adventures in the outdoors."
