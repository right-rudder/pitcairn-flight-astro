Medical Exam
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandates that pilots meet specific medical criteria to ensure their fitness for flying, both physically and mentally. At Pitcairn Flight Academy, we acknowledge that the medical evaluation may appear intimidating, and that's why we offer guidance and assistance to our students as they navigate this process.

We maintain close partnerships with certified aviation medical examiners and can connect you with an Aviation Medical Examiner (AME). Our skilled team of instructors is here to guide you through the examination procedure, outlining its components and potential disqualifying conditions for obtaining a pilot's license. We'll also arm you with practical advice on exam preparation, covering what to bring, what to anticipate on the examination day, and how to handle any potential challenges that may arise.

FAA Medical Exam
Written Exam
Earning your pilot's license requires successfully completing a pivotal written exam. This comprehensive test covers a wide spectrum of topics, from regulations and airspace to weather, aerodynamics, and aircraft performance. It's designed to evaluate your knowledge and confirm your grasp of the fundamental elements necessary for safe and proficient piloting.

We understand the potential challenges of completing the written exam, and we're fully devoted to aiding our students in their readiness. Our dedicated strategy involves offering in depth ground school training, led by seasoned instructors who will help you in mastering the study materials. With their guidance, you'll acquire a solid grasp of the essential exam topics, enabling you to complete the written exam with assurance and competence.

FAA Written Exam Preparation
Practical Flight Exam
The flight exam, commonly referred to as the checkride, is the last step in securing your pilot's license. Its purpose is to evaluate your capacity to operate an aircraft safely and proficiently across a range of flight scenarios. This examination comprises both oral and practical segments and is administered by an accredited FAA examiner.

At Pitcairn Flight Academy, we offer our students thorough flight training to guarantee their readiness. Rest assured that you're benefiting from top notch training and assistance to excel in the flight exam and attain your pilot's license. Our seasoned instructors will see to it that you're equipped with everything necessary for success.

Pitcairn Flight Academy Offers Training Options to Work With Your Schedule
Becoming a pilot starts with getting your private pilot certificate, granting you the ability to operate an aircraft as the pilot in charge. Training covers essential skills like flying maneuvers, navigation, handling emergencies, and planning cross-country flights. Many pursue this certification for leisure or sports, but it's the initial step towards a career as an airline pilot.

How Long Will it Take?
The time needed to earn a private pilot certificate can vary significantly, influenced by factors like weather, schedule availability, financial resources, and the frequency of flying lessons. If you choose to fly daily and study full time, you can obtain your pilot certificate in about two months.
