The Specifics

Commercial Certification Standards
250 hours total time, 100 hours pilot in command (PIC) time
You need to have the necessary amount of flight hours accrued in order to qualify to take the practical flight exam (checkride). Not all of the time needs to be done in an airplane. If you've flown helicopters or other aircraft, that time can be counted towards a commercial pilot certificate. Just as long as 100 of those hours were in powered aircraft and 50 of those hours were in an airplane.

50 hours of cross country flying
There are specific requirements for the types of cross country flying you need to have done. This includes the "long cross country" which is a 300 NM cross country of at least three different locations with two of the airports having a straight line distance of at least 250 NM. You'll also need to do two more cross country flights, each covering 100 nautical miles in two hours, with an instructor. One of these flights should be during the day, and the other at night.

10 hours of simulated or actual instrument flying time and 10 hours in a technically advanced aircraft.
If you do not have an instrument rating then your privileges as a commercial pilot is limited as you will be unable to fly for hire or compensation at night nor travel more than 50 NM miles. Instrument time in this case constitutes for training using a view-limiting device including attitude instrument flying, partial panel skills, recovery from unusual flight attitudes, and intercepting and tracking navigational systems. You'll also need 10 hours of training in a complex, turbine, or technically advanced airplane.

Receive flight training and endorsement from an authorized instructor
At least 20 hours of training must have been completed to qualify for the flight exam. This includes instrument flying, complex airplane flying, and cross country flights. Prior to taking the checkride, you need to have flown at least three hours with an authorized instructor in the preceding two calendar months.

Reference Airman Certification Standards and 14 CFR §61.123 for the entire list of eligibility requirements.
