The Specifics

Instructor Certification Requirements
Hold a commercial certificate and instrument rating
Obtaining your commercial certificate and instrument rating are prerequisites for qualifying to take your certified flight instructor certification practical exam. By having these two requirements fulfilled, that also entails that you already have a valid medical certificate as well. A class one medical is needed for airline Part 121 operations while smaller Part 135 and Part 91 operations may only require a second class medical.

Logged at least 250 hours total time
This requirement stems from having your commercial certificate done already. You need to have adequate experience and knowledge prior to being awarded the privileges of teaching student pilots how to fly. Of these 250 hours, at 15 hours must have been logged as PIC (pilot in command) in the category and class of aircraft that is appropriate to the flight instructor rating sought.

Have an endorsement from an authorized instructor
You must receive an endorsement from an authorized instructor which is a product of training under an authorized instructor. This endorsement must indicate that you are competent and possess instructional proficiency in stall awareness and spins.

Pass knowledge test on aeronautical knowledge areas
In addition to understanding and having the aeronautical knowledge areas for being a pilot, you need to also know how to teach this knowledge to your future students. This is known as the fundamentals of instructing which includes topics such as the learning process, elements of effective teaching, student evaluation and testing, course development, lesson planning, and classroom training techniques.

Reference Airman Practical Test Standards and 14 CFR §61.183 for the entire list of eligibility requirements.
